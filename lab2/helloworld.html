	<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Refresher</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to, with a partner, create a basic HTML file and a CSS style file, view it in our browser, and inspect it.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>Once again throwing myself into the coding world, I have absolutely no problems getting back into the groove of things. Truly, I am coding crazy.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>This page that you are on is the result of all my hard work. It's lookin' very nice.</p>

	<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>My name is Jeremy Jacob Francisco. I'm currently residing in Marina, California, but I am originally from the Philippines. I'm a second year, here at CSUMB, and I'm a CD major with a focus on game design.<br>
			My partner is Phillip Guaracha. He's from San Juan Bautista, also a second year here at CSUMB, and also a CD major. Me and Philip are gamers and we play games.</p>
