    <h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this lab was to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>Phillip and I first thought this lab to be a bit daunting but looking at examples and revisiting the lecture, we made good progress and got the lab done. The only real problem we faced was when my code kept on not giving me the JavaScript file on this page. It's really unfortunate because I can't really tell what would make it not work. Me and Phillip's JS scripting is similar, and there are no big differences, and the way in which we linked to the JS file in our HTML is the same.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>As you can hopefully see, my webpage showcases an understanding and good grasp on the content.</p>
