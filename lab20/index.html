      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Phillip and I are still trying to grasp JSON fully and use it to its fullest potential. Hopefully further experimentation will allow us to have a moment of clarity, as this is something both Phillip and I have had in the past when it comes to concepts we're not fully 100% on.</p>
