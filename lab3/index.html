	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer, add index.html files, and upload them to the server.<p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Thanks to Wes' awesome template, the work was essentially done for me. All I really had to do was actually write content into the index files and such, but other than that, I had no problems doing this lab, aside from centering my images.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Below you'll find the screenshot of my work.</p>
