	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to get into the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>Phillip Guaracha and I had to elaborate a bit more on the instructions of the lab before actually diving into the pseudocoding process, and determining which actions we wanted to focus on, but after going back and forth with one another, we figured out the instructions and we figured out which task should be performed.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Below, you'll find the pseudocoding we did for an everyday task, and the pseudocoding for our computer task.</p>
