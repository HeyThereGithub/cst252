			<div class="introduction">
				<p>Hey there, I'm Jeremy Jacob Francisco, and this is my awesome CST252 homepage. I am a second year here at CSUMB, majoring in CD and focusing on game design. I like many things, such as drawing, talking to people, and playing video games. I also like cleaning, but really only when it'll distract me from doing homework and stuff. I'm prety alright at coding.</p>
