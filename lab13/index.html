    <h1>Lab 13 Basic Debugging</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this lab was to get us to look back at our code and fix whatever may be wrong with it.</p>
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The only trouble Phillip and I keep facing is that our JS output never shows up when we try. We're really not sure why. Our JavaScript code works through the console and it does what we ask, but we still cannot get our Output to show up.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>All labs are working, except for those whose outputs refuse to cooperate with us.</p>
